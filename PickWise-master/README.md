PickWise is an app designed to provide students with an easier and faster way to choose lectures for each semester, as well as the opportunity to rate professors they have previously interacted with during lectures or labs.

The app eliminates the need for a sign-up process, as students can use their university-assigned ID and the password they chose during university registration to log in. Once logged in, users will be greeted with the home page, which displays their name and several features. On this page, students can view the subjects for their current semester and navigate between different pages using a navigation bar located at the bottom of the display.

The home page also includes a filter with five buttons, allowing students to switch between different semesters. For example, if a student clicks on the number 4, they will be directed to the corresponding semester's subjects. In each of these subject pages, students can click on individual subjects to view the professors who offer the course. This page will display professors along with their contact information, such as phone number, name, email, and picture. By clicking on a professor, the student will be redirected to another page that displays the professor's overall rating and four sub-ratings. Additionally, there will be comments from other students. However, these will be anonymous.

If the student has already taken a subject with this professor, they will be able to rate them by clicking on "Rate" and proceeding to the next page. Otherwise, this will be the last page they view.

The navigation bar at the bottom of the app contains four different items. The first item directs the user to the home screen, the second item is for accessing the profile to view personal information, the third item is the leaderboard button, and  the fourth item is a log out button.
Regarding the professor ratings, the app uses the database we created at the start to collect different ratings to establish the leaderboard, ranking all the professors accordingly. The leaderboard page displays the top 10 professors and their ratings.
